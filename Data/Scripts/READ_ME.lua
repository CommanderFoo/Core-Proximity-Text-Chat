--[[
Checks the distance between the speaker and other players to determine who is in range. If anyone is in range of the speaker then they will see the message.

There is a distance value on the script that can be set. Default is 15 metres for testing.

The downside of this, is that the text color is changed because the script needs to rebroadcast to those players in range.
